TO-DO List
-----------
* Simplification: Remove abstraction of entity/entity attribute purposes, work directly with kotlin-model. Make that sense?
* Facet to facet dependencies (to have a correct calculation order)?
* Better/Streamlined exception handling

* Default-Values in XML on each level (with the meaningful/allowed attributes)
* POC for kotlin templates (from freemarker templates)
* ids in xml to connect fields together (for foreign key relations)
* support/POC for nested entities (entities that point to other entities) (needed for stored structures like JSON)
